Headers Headers usually have a large hero image with a website logo, navigation bar, and hero text box. Preliminary Planning You should first create a rough design of how your header will look. There are various ways to accomplish this: pencil illustrations, wire framing, photoshop, etc. Every header is unique, but the common components included are are a logo, navigation menu, hero text, call-to-action button, and a background image. Decide which background image you will be using, otherwise select a background color (or gradient) if no image will be used. It's also important to define positioning for each item you include. Hero Background Dimensions See: Guide to Properly Size Your Hero Images and Optimize Them for Site Speed . 1600 x 1000px or sometimes 1920 x 1200px Coding Your Header index.html Begin with the semantic <header> ... </header> HTML tags. style.css Height \u2013 One of the first things you want to do is define a height for your header. This can be be a fixed height in px units, a percentage, min-height , or even the vh (viewport height) if you want it that large. Width \u2013 For the most part, the width is usually 100% for responsive-purposes. Even if the parent element of your header has a fixed width that is not the full page's width, your header will display at 100% of the container. Background Color \u2013 Before we add a background image, it's best practice to define a fallback color for the header in case the image does not load correctly. Example: background-color: rgb(73, 1, 147); Background Image \u2013 Ensure the image you will be using resides within your css/img/ or ../img/ folder. Using your header property, include background-image: url('../img/home-bg.jpg'); to your CSS. Background Image Linear Gradient \u2013 If you want add a transparent color overlay atop of your background image, you can accomplish that with the following: background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)), url(img/hero.jpg); Putting It Altogether \u2013 header { background-image : linear-gradient ( rgba ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0.7 ), rgba ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0.7 )), url ( img/hero.jpg ); background-size : cover ; background-position : center ; height : 100 vh ; } Adding a Text Box Within your <header> tags, include a new div tag for your text box such as: <div class=\"hero-text-box\"></div> . Inside that text box div, you can include a heading and other text. <h1>Goodbye junk food. Hello super healthy meals.</h1> <a href=\"#\">I'm hungry</a> Centering Your Text Box In your style.css stylesheet, utilize your .hero-text-box class and add the following declarations: . hero-text-box { position : absolute ; width : 1140 px ; top : 50 % ; left : 50 % ; transform : translate ( -50 % , -50 % ); } position: absolute The only way we can vertically and horizontally position a box is by using the position: absolute declaration.
